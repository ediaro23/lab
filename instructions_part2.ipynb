I advise to work out something that is such that the starting and final velocities are 0. \n",

    "The class Bezier defined in [bezier.py](https://github.com/ediaro23/lab/blob/main/bezier.py) might prove useful.\n",
    "Take a look at the [primer on Bezier curves](https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/) if you want more info on these methods. An example of use is provided in [control.py](https://github.com/ediaro23/lab/blob/9a2b0c74b4ba1702da8f86fc1fa845e513ab4cfd/control.py#L47).\n",

    "+ First, they are strictly equivalent to polynomials, which means that the trajectory you will compute will be continuous and infinitely differentiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Secondly, the initial and terminal conditions are easy to specify: the velocity at the start / end only depends on the first/last two control points, and the accelerations only on the the first/last three control points. If you choose your first three control points to be strictly equal for instance, the initial velocity and acceleration of your trajectory will be 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Thirdly, a Bezier curve lies completely in the convex hull of its control points. What this means for optimisation is that if you define linear inequality constraints on the control points of the curve, you have the guarantee that that every point on the curve satisfies these constraints. This will allow you to easily specify constraints on the derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose to go that way, you can decide that your optimisation variables are the control points of your Bezier curve; you can then linearly define the value of the trajectory at each time step as a linear combination of these control points and write your cost function as a function of these points.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, the idea is not to explicitely address the collision constraints. You will assume that if you track your path well enough you will avoid collisions. This is commonly done in robotics.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you are interested in trajectory optimisation, you could check out [this tutorial I wrote for the ndcurves library](https://github.com/loco-3d/ndcurves/blob/master/python/test/sandbox/test.ipynb). While the API is different the concepts described are the same. **Note that I m not necessarily suggesting to use ndcurves, simply to look at the tutorials to understand the ideas and replicate this.** Still, if you want to you can decide to directly use ndcurves. It has an api a bit more complex that the simple Bezier class I provided as it is more powerful, so it is for you to decide, there is no good or bad solution here.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time parametrisation:\n",
    "If you follow the guidelines from the tutorial, the optimisation will give you a smooth trajectory, but by default it will have a duration of 1. You can easily add velocity constraints and include time as a variable in your problem . You could also add acceleration constraints and ignore velocities by using $t^2$ as a variable instead of $t$. We can discuss this on Piazza. You can't consider both velocity and acceleration constraints otherwise your problem will become non-linear (do you see why ?)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling grasping constraints:\n",
    "If you are planning a trajectory just for the effectors then it is really easy to handle these constraints: you can just plan for the cube and then deduce the effector placements at each step.\n",
    "It might be harder to do it for a configuration space trajectory, but it is not necessarily required:\n",
    "I believe that if the tracked trajectory is good enough you should not need to handle the grasping constraints as accurately as this will be fixed by the control law. \n",
    "If you want to handle these constraints, there are a variety of post processes that you can choose to implement this, but though the problem becomes non-linear again... I suggest to avoid this unless it really proves useful (again I think not, or at least it was not necessary for me).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. level 2: Handling collision constraints\n",
    "First of all, don't go there in the first instance. Wait until you are done with the complete lab to decide whether you are interested in doing this. You can try to handle collisions in a variety of ways that we can discuss on Piazza. The straightforward approach is to write a non linear program that will handle this as we have done before. Because you have a reference motion that is collision free, you may get away with a NLP to refine the trajectory obtained when solving level 1 so as to avoid collisions."

    "To test your controller, it might be a good idea to first control the motion of the effectors without grasping the cube. Generate a simple trajectory that brings the effectors above the starting position and implement the control law to achieve the motion. Regarding the gains, you definitely have the options to tune them individually for each joint (and you would have do this on the actual robot). When I programmed the lab I just used Kp = 300 and $Kd = 2 \\sqrt(Kd)$ for all joints and it worked fine. Once you ll have verified that you obtain a satisfying behaviour, you'll be ready to move to the actual task.\n",

You can push the cube to align it in the end if you need. \n",
